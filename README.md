# TODO Applet

A local web-app to keep track of current TODOs. 

Made using Javascript.

## Features

The app helps you keep a track of all the items in your TODO list.

You can check any of the items when you are done with them.
You can also delete an item if you no longer wish to see it in the list. 

The app tells you a count of items you have on the list and also a count of the items that you're yet to finish.

All you data is retained even if you close or refresh the window. Thought the data will not be visible on a different browser.

### Note
The project is still under work, functionality and styling will be added.
Use on the same browser to avoid any loss of data.
